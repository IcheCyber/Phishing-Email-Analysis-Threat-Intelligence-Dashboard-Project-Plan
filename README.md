# 🛡️ Phishing Analysis & Threat Intelligence Dashboard Project

## 🌟 Overview
This project is a complete, end-to-end simulation of a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst workflow, focused on phishing threat detection and intelligence. I built a functional Threat Intelligence (TI) dashboard using **Splunk** (free version) and public threat data to analyze, enrich, and visualize Indicators of Compromise (IOCs). This demonstrates practical experience with SIEM operations, threat modeling, and professional security documentation.

## 🛠️ Key Technologies & Skills Demonstrated
* **SIEM Operations:** Data ingestion, search queries, and dashboard creation using **Splunk Enterprise (Free)**.
* **Threat Intelligence (TI):** Using public tools like **VirusTotal, urlscan.io, and Whois** to enrich IOCs (URLs, Domains, IPs).
* **Threat Modeling:** Mapping phishing techniques to the **MITRE ATT&CK Framework** (e.g., T1566.002, T1598.003).
* **Data Analysis:** Creating and managing an IOC tracker in **Google Sheets**.
* **Documentation:** Producing a professional **Analysis Report** detailing methodology, findings, and recommendations.

## 🎯 Final Deliverables
* **IOC Tracker Spreadsheet** with enriched threat data.
* **Splunk Threat Intelligence Dashboard** (Screenshots).
* **Detailed Analysis Report** (Methodology, Findings, Risk Assessment, Recommendations).
* **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping Sheet**.
